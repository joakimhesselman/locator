How to "Publish":

Save the files: Create a folder named success-locator (or similar). Save the code blocks above as index.html, style.css, and script.js inside that folder.
Choose a Host:
GitHub Pages (Recommended):
Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., success-locator).
Upload the entire success-locator folder content (the three files) to the repository.
Go to the repository's Settings > Pages.
Under Build and deployment, select Deploy from a branch.
Choose the main (or master) branch and the / (root) folder. Click Save.
Wait a few minutes. GitHub will provide you with a public URL (like your-username.github.io/success-locator/).
Netlify/Vercel:
Sign up for a free account.
You can often just drag and drop the success-locator folder onto their dashboard to deploy. Or connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments. They will provide a public URL.
Important Notes:

HTTPS Required: Geolocation APIs generally require a secure context (HTTPS). Most hosting providers (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) provide HTTPS automatically. If you try to run index.html directly from your local file system (file:///...), geolocation might not work in some browsers due to security restrictions.
Location Permissions: The app will prompt the user for permission to access their location the first time they visit. If they deny it, the app will display an error.
Accuracy: GPS accuracy varies depending on the device, environment (indoors vs. outdoors), and browser implementation.
Neo-Brutalism: This style is subjective. Feel free to tweak colors (#FF0000 for the arrow, #0000FF for distance, etc.), borders, shadows (box-shadow), and fonts in the style.css file to better match your vision.
